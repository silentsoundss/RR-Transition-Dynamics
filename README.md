# RR-Transition-Dynamics
This is a notebook created to accompany an undergraduate thesis written to complete the Honors program in Economics at UCLA. This project is currently in progress.

Note: You can simply open the file to view the code and output. The replication preserves the full structure of the RR model and reproduces all relative statistics and counterfactual TFP losses. Differences in aggregate values K, Y, S arise from either the 3-bin fallback in the absence of the original data (since viewed online I made it self-contained), or numerical differences like the density of the grid.
